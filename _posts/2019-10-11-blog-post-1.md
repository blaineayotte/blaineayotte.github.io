This blog post will be an old homework assignment from the Data Analysis of Complex Systems course. The assignment focuses on the n-body problem in celestial mechanics. In this work, we not only generate a working simulation of the n-body problem using ordinary differential equation (ode) solvers, we also apply equation-free modeling techniques to this system. Detials are given in [ee520-hw7.pdf](http://mackkv.github.io/files/ee520-hw7.pdf).
