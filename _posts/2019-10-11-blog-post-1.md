This blog post will be an old homework assignment from the Data Analysis of Complex Systems course. This assignment focuses on the n-body problem in celestial mechanics. In this assignment we not only generate a working simulation of the n-body problem using ordinary differential equation (ode) solvers, we also apply techniques to model this system with equation-free modeling techniques.
