This post is a project from my Detection and Estimation course. The project is an analysis of the performance of three communication schemes in the presence of noise. The bit error rate is simulated with a monte-carlo simulation, for each scheme and at various SNR's. The details can be found in [ee526-project-2-mackkv.pdf](http://mackkv.github.io/files/ee526-project-2-mackkv.pdf).
