Abstract: 'Keystroke dynamics are a powerful behavioral biometric capable of determining user identity and for continuous authentication. It is an unobtrusive method that can complement an existing security system such as a password scheme and provides continuous user authentication. Existing methods record all keystrokes and use n-graphs that measure the timing between consecutive keystrokes to distinguish between users. Current state-of-the-art algorithms report EER's of 7.5% or higher with 1000 characters. With 1000 characters it takes a longer time to detect an imposter and significant damage could be done. In this paper, we investigate how quickly a user is authenticated or how many digraphs are required to accurately detect an imposter in an uncontrolled free-text environment. We present and evaluate the effectiveness of three distance metrics individually and fused with each other. We show that with just 100 digraphs, about the length of a single sentence, we achieve an EER of 35.3%. At 200 digraphs the EER drops to 15.3%. With more digraphs, the performance continues to steadily improve. With 1000 digraphs the EER drops to 3.6% which is an improvement over the state-of-the-art.'
