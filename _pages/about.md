I'm a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Engineering and a research assisstant in the <a href="https://cosine.clarkson.edu/">CoSiNe Lab</a> at Clarkson University. My focus is on various topics in Machine Learning, Signal Processing, and Communications. I have also worked on engineering education projects, with a focus on using mobile apps as tools for learning. This site is still a work in progress, and is being updated incrimentally to include projects that I have worked on, and works that can be found publicly.


Some quick examples of my interests and work
