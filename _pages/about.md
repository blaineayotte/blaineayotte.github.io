I am a graduate student and research assisstant in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/clarkson.edu/cu-cosine-lab/home">CoSiNe Lab</a> at Clarkson University. My current research involves behavioral biometrics with a focus on Keystroke Dynamics. Keystroke dynamics is the study of users input text via their keyboards. Our recent work focuses on reducing the number of characters typed before authentication can occur. A short keystroke dynamics demo about password hardening can be found on the Demo tab.
