**EDUCATION**

**UNDERGRADUATE:**

BS, Physics and Mathematics, May 2017 , **St. Lawrence University** , Canton, NY

Physics Major GPA: 3.889/4.000; Math Major GPA: 3.875/4.000; Overall GPA: 3.821/4.

**GRADUATE:**
MS, Electrical and Computer Engineering, August 2019, **Clarkson University** , Potsdam, NY
PhD, Electrical and Computer Engineering, **Clarkson University** , Potsdam, NY (Expected Date of Graduation: May 202 1 )

**RESEARCH EXPERIENCE**

My current research is on keystroke dynamics which studies how people input text via their keyboards. More specifically,
I have been working to reduce the number of keystrokes before an accurate authentication can be made. An example of
how keystroke dynamics can be used to protect passwords is available on my website blaineayotte.github.io/demo.
Previous research includes behavioral biometrics for mobile authentication using touch, location, and other features.

**OHER PROJECTS**
I am self-taught using Arduino microprocessors. I have built a remote controlled/self-driving car with RF transmitter and
receiver. I also have built an automatic plant watering system that measures moisture content in soil and if it is below a
specified threshold the Arduino will turn on a water pump.

Designed and built prototype robot (AiRobot) that drives around a room with air quality, humidity, and temperature
sensors creating maps of the environment. An air humidifier, heater, or purifier can be placed on the robot and it will
drive the source of pollution, or low humidity and turn on the appliance. By bringing the solution to the source AiRobot
intelligently solves the problem. Project available online at: https://www.hackster.io/104667/airobot- 320828

I lead a team of students in the Clarkson University 2019 Presidents Challenge to submit a keystroke dynamics based
project to serve the global community. Challenge description: Using the Internet of Things (IoT) to make the global
community a better place. We achieved 2 nd runner up in the Global division.

Volunteered at Terrra science and engineering fair in Potsdam NY. Helped to judge students work and provide positive
feedback for students in grades 5- 12 projects.

**SKILLS**
Proficient in MS Office, LaTex (PDF Writer), Python (packages include: OpenCV, keras, tensorflow, numpy, scipy,
pandas, sklearn, etc.), Matlab, Arduino, and familiar with Android Studio, C++, javascript, sql, and html.
